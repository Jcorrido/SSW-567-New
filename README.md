HW 04a

This HW was very difficult particularly because I didn't have a lot of background in 
API coding though it is definitly something I should start to learn. Regardless I was
able to complete it. Testing was particularly difficult as I kept having my API 
request limit be reached which was a pain. The tests however that I did create
do assume what is necessary, that dictionaries for a given person are filled,
that there are commits for a given repo, and that they are recieving the 
correct number of commits. I definitly faced a challenge when it came to understanding
how to interact with the API using the request and json libraries, as well as properly
setting up the config.yml. But using the tutorials made it fine.

fyi the tests in TestTriangle.py fail but the ones in TestGetApi.py work
